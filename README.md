Before getting started you need to download futurerestore and place it in the directory with this program
This program is only compatible with Mac but I will expand to Linux in the future

place futurerestore_macos in the same directory as downgrade.py

You also need to have python 3 installed

To get started just open terminal and type ./downgrade.sh in the directory with the 32bit iOS downgrader application
